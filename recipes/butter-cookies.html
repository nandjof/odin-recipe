        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 - 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fruit preserves, any flavor</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Step 2: In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, white 
                sugar and egg yolks. Mix in flour a little bit at a time until 
                a soft dough forms. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. If dough is 
                too soft, refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes. Place balls 2 
                inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Use your finger or 
                an instrument of similar size to make a well in the center of 
                each cookie. Fill the hole with 1/2 teaspoon of preserves.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until 
                golden brown on the bottom. Remove from cookie sheets to cool 
                on wire racks.</li>
